# Project 3

### By anonymous login or not

Name: KarmaComments.com

Overview: A way for people to connect online and share, based on random selection, how their actions and words affect =>themselves<=

Step one: System chooses by random a main postee, of which who will write words that will, to their surprise affect them and everyone else around them.

Step two: Commenters will be selected at random to write what they thought the meaning of the words the postee had said, and to their surprise they will affect everyone around them and themselves.

Step three: Comments will only show after 1 day.

Step four: Comments will be disabled.

Step five: After 1 day the system will ask for the postee to reveal how they felt about their own post and what everyone else had to say about it and what they really meant to say. The postee will be given a chance to redeem themselves from their wrong and/or from the wrongs of the commentees whos perspective was theirs and not of the postees. Comments will be disabled.

Step six: After 1 day the system will ask the commenters to reveal how they felt about their own comment and about the postee's post. They will be given a chance to redeem themselves for their wrongs and/or from the wrongs of everyone else see how their perspective was from the sight of themselves and not from the sight of the postees. The ones who were able to let their egos aside and feelings aside from them will see they were able to contribute positive energy to something which could be taken into a negative energy way. Comments will be disabled.

Step seven: After 2 days the system will ask the postee about how they felt about the outcome of what they said and how everyone else took it. Super moderators will add hints to the system, hints will point out the blind paths people will take. Blind paths being those paths people take where they walk with themselves in sight so close they cant find the way only to fall off the side of the mountain. Comments will be disabled.

Step eight: After 2 days the system will ask the commenters about how they felt about the outcome of what they said and how the postee took it. Super moderators will add hints about perspective and accumulation of totality. This is to paint the big picture for many people, whos picture may only include themselves. Comments will be disabled.

Step nine: Data analysis will reveal that between the 2 parties, everything is a 2 way road. Sometimes everyone just wants to walk on one side of it while one person is alone on the other side. Comments will be disabled.

Step ten: Data analysis will reveal that perspective is only to the eye of the beholder, and the eye of the beholder can be blind. They may only see themselves in the road. An entire system to convince people that even though they focus on themselves as much as they do, they actually do matter to other people. So much so that even through total blindness people will still love them. Comments will be disabled.

### Who uses it: People who are interested in growing up.

### What outputs do they need: They need to know how they affect everyone else and also themselves with what they assume, with what they say and what they do, no matter who you are.

### What inputs do I need to generate those outputs: The thoughts of people.

### Technologies used: HTML, CSS SQL, KNEX, Postgres, express.js, Materialize

### User info: View mode (not logged in), user logged in, moderator login, admin login

### Working Output: Data that can be used for things like online reviews, the intention can be analyzed with this data to see if the user was reviewing themselves of if they were reviewing the product.

### KarmaComments: Will use the input from users (like a 1-10 numerical selection about how they felt) and combine that with technologies that can connect words and numerical values to make trends of data. Trends of data will reveal how words affect all people and can be used to completely change everything and anything around them. Data will reveal perspective of change, what if, someone (everyone changed). The many on one side of the road will see themselves and the one person alone on the other and they will no longer be divided.

# What I want to prove:

User logged into MyEdibleReviewApp.com and it asks, how was your day?

User selects how their day was.

For example 1 we will use 'Good'

Example 1

```
User logs into MyEdibleReviewApp.com and reveals they are feeling good
User buys or reviews a product
MyEdibleReviewApp asks the user again how they are feeling

Output:
  Based on data MyEdibleReviewApp can try to 'assume' that the user is going to:

  1. Probably going to give a good review about the PRODUCT
  2. Probably going to give a bad review about the PRODUCT

```

For example 2 we will use 'Bad'

Example 2

```
User logs into MyEdibleReviewApp.com and reveals they are feeling bad
User buys or reviews a product
MyEdibleReviewApp asks the user again how they are feeling

Output:
  Based on data MyEdibleReviewApp can try to 'assume' that the user is going to:

  1. Probably going to give a good review about THEMSELVES
  2. Probably going to give a bad review about THEMSELVES
